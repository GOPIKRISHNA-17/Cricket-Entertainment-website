Cricket's history was expanded with the introduction of the Ashes series between England and Australia in 1882, which sparked fierce rivalries and further cemented cricket's appeal on a worldwide scale. As cricket continued to gain ground in new areas, it developed into a tool for fostering international understanding and cultural interaction that cut across borders and brought nations together on the playing field. Because of the MCC's dedication to upholding the integrity and principles of the game, it has become an iconic institution that is respected by both cricket players and fans.
